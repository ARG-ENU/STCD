Car clubs
In the coming years, London faces challenges of population growth, congestion and the environment. Car clubs provide a cost-effective and flexible alternative to owning a car, and can help tackle these challenges.

Joining a car club provides the convenience of owning a car without the hassle or costs of repairs, servicing or parking. Members can book cars locally for just an hour, up to a whole weekend, or longer. 

If you haven't used a car club before, find out how they work.

Search our map to find your nearest fixed car club bay.
