About Us How does the cycle to work scheme operate?
The cycle to work initiative is a tax-efficient, and on the whole, salary-sacrificed employee benefit, introduced in 1999 Finance Act, that provides a way of encouraging more adults to take up cycling.

The savings that individuals make through the cycle to work scheme improves the affordability of, and access to, cycling. Employees who participate in schemes run by Alliance members can save up to 42% of the total cost of a new bike.

What contribution does the scheme make?
Increasing participation in cycling: 

To date over 1 million people have taken advantage of the scheme, which involves over 2,500 bike retailers and 53,500 employers.

The scheme has a track record of achieving behavioural change amongst those not currently cycling regularly. 62% of participants were either non-cyclists, novice cyclists or occasional cyclists before joining the scheme. Having joined the scheme 79% of respondents described themselves as enthusiastic cyclists.

Similarly, those joining the scheme commute to work by bike on a regular basis. Two thirds of participants use their bike to cycle to work for the majority of their commuting (on at least three or more days).

Environmental impact: 

The scheme is an effective mechanism for achieving a shift in behaviour towards sustainable travel. Two thirds of participants are cycling more than previously.

Nearly three quarters of participants (73%) have reduced the amount that they drive since joining the scheme.

Making cycling affordable:

A majority of participants joined the scheme as they were attracted by the savings that it offered (81%) or because they could spread the cost over a 12/18 month period (58%).
