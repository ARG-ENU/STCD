WHAT IS WOW?
WOW IS LIVING STREETS' YEAR-ROUND WALK TO SCHOOL CHALLENGE

Pupils record how they get to school each day on the interactive WOW Travel Tracker and those who walk (skate, scoot, cycle or Park & Stride!) at least once per week for a month are rewarded with a themed badge. It's that easy!

It's simple to run and children love talking part. Each year, the 11 WOW badges follow a new WOW theme, all of which are designed by pupils in our annual badge design competition. Each badge is made in the UK from recycled yoghurt-pot material. WOW will help develop healthy lifelong habits and reduce congestion at the school gates, all before the school day begins!
