MetroBus: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Metrobus is a new, modern public transport service for the greater Bristol area.

Metrobus offers faster, more frequent and more reliable services with direct routes to key destinations. It uses new, modern, environmentally-friendly vehicles with USB sockets and free Wi-Fi. The buses have an extra pair of doors to speed up getting on and off.

It's also a ‘buy before you board service’ with ticket machines at every stop, for quicker journeys.

MetroBus is part of the West of England’s plan to:

reduce carbon emissions
support sustainable economic growth
promote accessibility
contribute to better safety, security and health
improve quality of life and create a healthy natural environment

passenger transport improvements (MetroBus and new bus links)
measures to improve cycling and walking
traffic and parking management
improvements to rail via MetroWest
