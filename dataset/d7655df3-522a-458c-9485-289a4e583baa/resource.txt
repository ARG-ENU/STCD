Switch off and breathe
The East Central Scotland Vehicle Emissions Partnership was created in 2004 to help improve air quality across Scotland. We work in conjunction with the Scottish Government, East Lothian, Midlothian, West Lothian and Falkirk Councils, with a remit to encourage road users to improve their environment by providing free educational events within east central Scotland.

Air pollution, caused by transportation, accounts for up to 40,000 deaths within the UK each year. This is more than 10 times higher than the annual number of fatal road traffic accidents.

Most people think that that CO2 is the harmful component of exhaust gases due to past media campaigns and the drive to have lower CO2 emissions over the past 20 years. It is important for its contribution to the Greenhouse effect and global warming, but it is not what causes ill health. Exhaust fumes contain other chemicals and particulates that long term exposure to has been linked with causing Cancer, Asthma and other respiratory diseases.

If you are stationary for more than a few minutes
then switch off your engine.
This simple action saves you money, improves our health
and protects the environment.
Free Emission Testing
Cars which produce excessive exhaust emissions harm human health, waste fuel and can be illegal on Scotland’s roads.

The free emission test uses the same equipment that forms part of a MOT test and
identifies potential faults in the fuel, engine and exhaust systems, allowing repairs to be carried out at a later date.

The test is completely free of charge.
