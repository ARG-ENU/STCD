Why
Bikeability is government-recognised, practical and professional training, and we know that cyclists are more skilled and more confident once they’ve taken part.

Getting skilled-up for cycling has big benefits.
Great way to get around
Cycling is a great way to get around, get some exercise, and reduce the amount of time spent stuck in a car, or on the bus.

Quicker, low-cost journeys
Taking part in Bikeability means that you’ll be getting ready to enjoy all the benefits of cycling – quicker and low cost journeys, fun rides you can make with friends and family, and less time wasted in the car, or waiting for a lift.

Government-recognised cycle training
Bikeability is the only government-recognised cycle training scheme, underpinned by national standards. Cycle training providers delivering Bikeability must use professional National Standard Instructors and operate within our quality assurance system. Bikeability is therefore a quality mark for cycle training, identifying cycle training delivered to the highest standards.
