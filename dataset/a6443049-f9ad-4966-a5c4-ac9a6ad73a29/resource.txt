Posted on  January 4, 2013 by   Andy Henderson  
Perhaps you never learnt to cycle.

Perhaps you learnt as a child, but you’ve not cycled since.

Maybe you had a bad experience that put you off cycling.

Perhaps you’re worried about cycling in traffic.

Whatever the reason, the prospect of getting on a bike can be intimidating, and you might need some specialist help.

 

Our Bikeability and cycle training project is setting up one-to-one training for adults that want to get (back) into cycling.  We have Bikeability trained instructors in Cycle Hayling and we’d be pleased to discuss your specific needs.  If we can’t help – we’ll try to find someone that can.  Contact robert@cyclehayling.org.uk

Alternatively, you can try contacting Bikeability direct.
