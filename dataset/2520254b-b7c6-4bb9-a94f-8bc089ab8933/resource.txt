Once in Bristol, visit the Tourist Information Centre on Harbourside to purchase day, season or multiple journey tickets for local buses, city sightseeing bus tours and ferries.

Bus
It's really easy to get around Bristol by bus, with plenty of fast and convenient services available from all key locations.

You can find out more about Bristol bus routes and timetables at www.firstgroup.com/bristol. 

If you're in Bristol and need help with finding bus stations and routes, the Tourist Information Centre on the harbourside is on hand to help. You can buy day, season and multiple journey tickets direct from them too.

Another great way to see the city is through a guided tour on-board a City Sightseeing Bus. Let the expert driver tell you all about the sights and scenery along the way, and hop on and off as many times as you like. Tickets are on sale at the Tourist Information Centre.

Travel by car
Bristol has plenty of city centre car parks, including a multi-story offering 2,600 spaces for Cabot Circus shoppers. You can find out more about Bristol car parks and travelling by car at www.travelwest.info/drive.

If you're driving to Bristol, why not take advantage of one of the fantastic Park and Ride services? Avoid all of the stress of driving around a new city, save money and do your bit for the environment. Find out more about Bristol Park & Ride services at www.travelwest.info/parkandride.

Train
Bristol is at the hub of the national rail network in the West of England. Great Western Railway and other major train operators run local, regional and inter-city services from Bristol Temple Meads Railway Station and Bristol Parkway Railway Station.

Boat
Number Seven Boats and Bristol Ferry Boats operate regular ferry services to and from waterfront attractions and key points along the harbourside. The Bristol Packet runs guided trips around Bristol and along the river Avon to Bath.

For a journey with a difference, Avon River Cruises run private charter hire trips around Bristol harbour and on the River Avon, with on-board catering if required.
