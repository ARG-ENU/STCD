CYCLE
Why cycle?
It’s a practical and cheaper way to keep fit – no MOT, insurance, fuel or parking costs!

58% of all car trips are less than 5 miles, approximately a half hour cycle ride (Source: Department for Transport).  Switching short journeys from car to bicycle will benefit your community. You'll be helping to reduce noise and air pollution as well as traffic congestion.

All participating organisations are less than 5 miles from the surrounding main towns:

Wallingford (~2miles)
Cholsey (~ 3miles)
Benson (~3 miles).
The distances above are average and vary depending on the organisation you cycle to.

Bike bus and other facilities for cyclists
Some companies offer facilities for cyclists, such as showers, cycle racks, drying cupboards pool bikes. Also keen cyclists have recently organised a bike bus, which makes the commuting journey more friendly. For further information, contact your green transport representative/facility manager.
