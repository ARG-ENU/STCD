Walkers' stories
Every week across England over 375 schemes support 20,000 walkers to get and stay active.
Here you can read a few of the inspiring stories from our walkers. Their stories show how walking regularly with their local scheme has helped them become healthier, happier, make new friends and explore their local area.
