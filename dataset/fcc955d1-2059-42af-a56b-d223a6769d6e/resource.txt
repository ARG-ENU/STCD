Posted on  January 15, 2013 by   Andy Henderson  
The Highway code has two sections for specifically for cyclists.  They are clear and offer good advice.

You read them at the gov.uk web site:

Roundabouts
Crossing the road

If you have no experience on the road, see if our Bikeability and cycle training project can help.
