Electric vehicles are available for use by the University – University departments can book by telephone 01670 540222, email contact@phoenixtaxis.net, via an online booking website http://www.phoenixtaxis.net/book-a-taxi.html or through their booking app for smartphones/iPhones http://www.phoenixtaxis.net/iphone-app.html. You can track the taxi live using either the website or the app.
