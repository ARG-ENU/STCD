Learn to ride together, with quick and easy games that are perfect for playtime
 
Riding a bike gives you a great sense of freedom – and we think every child in Britain should have the chance to learn. That’s why we created HSBC UK Ready Set Ride, with free, quick and easy games to help you teach your child how to pedal – having lots of fun along the way.

Kids can start at any age and there is no pressure to start pedalling on your first go. In fact, you don’t need a bike or any cycling knowledge to get started. Plus we have lots of helpful information about bikes, knowing when your child is ready to ride and how you can use household items to play any of the games in your own home.

To start your learn to ride journey together, simply click on Activities and explore over 20 free games.
