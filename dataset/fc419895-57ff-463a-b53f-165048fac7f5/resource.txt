Walking
Walking is a great way to have time to yourself and gives you more energy to do the things you enjoy in life. In the working day it can also help you to unwind and make plans and avoid the stress of traffic jams.

May was the National Walking Month and to encourage staff and students to increase walking during the month and beyond, the University promoted the Living Streets #Try20 tips.

The University also ran its own 'walk week' to promote guided and local walks including self-guided walks around the Botanic Garden and the Hay Meadow walk, which are set out in the timetable below.
