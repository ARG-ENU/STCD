Walking
Walking is the most sustainable way to travel. It's free, enjoyable and can help you lead an active and healthy lifestyle.

Walking will help protect you against:

Cardio vascular diesease (coronary heart disease and stroke), as well as 'risk factors' such as high blood pressure and cholesterol.
Cancer (particularly bowel cancer, and breast cancer in post-menopausal women)
Type 2 diabetes
Obesity
It has also been shown to improve:

Musculoskeletal health (for example osteoarthritis and lower back pain)
Mental health, happiness and well-being
