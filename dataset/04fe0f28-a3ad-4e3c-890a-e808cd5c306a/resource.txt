Bus & Train Week 2016

We are pleased to announce the introduction of three electric vehicle charging points at the University.

Located in the Main site, Fitzwilliam Street and Riddel Hall car parks, the charging points have been installed with the support of the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV). They are part of an expansion of the charging network across the public sector estate in Northern Ireland. 

The points, which are a further example of the University's commitment to sustainable travel, can be used by staff who hold permits for the location car parks.  

More information on charging, including a list of charge points across Northern Ireland, can be found on the eCarNI website.
