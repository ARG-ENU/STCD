Travel by motorcycle

Why?

Environmental: a powered two-wheeler (motorcycle / scooter) is generally more fuel efficient than a motor car, so produces less harmful emissions 
Physical: takes up less road in terms of congestion and space for parking 
Time: Priority routes for motorcycles (and bicycles) through bus lanes helps to avoid traffic jams and decreases journey times. 
How?

Motorcycles can be parked anywhere on site where there is space, excluding yellow hatched lines, designated car parking space and access/egress to buildings
