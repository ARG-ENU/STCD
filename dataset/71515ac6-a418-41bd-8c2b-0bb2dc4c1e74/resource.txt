Would you walk more if you thought you could find your way around London? There's no excuse, thanks to Legible London street signs.
Midilith in Croydon
Legible London signage, Croydon
Legible London is a system of map-based street signs designed to make London that little bit easier to walk around.

It means that, for shorter journeys, you can swap your usual route for a healthy, and often quicker, walk instead.

Our maps provide useful information about local areas, including realistic walking times between places which can range between 5 to 15 minutes. Legible London also includes easy-to-spot signposts with a distinctive navy blue and yellow design. You can find them on streets, in bus shelters and at Tube and mainline rail stations. So far, we've put signs in nearly every London borough.

Legible London is demand-led and mainly delivered through borough funds. Find out more about how Legible London works.
