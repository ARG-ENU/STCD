Why Car Share?
Currently CO2 emissions from cars make up 13% of the UK total. As well as harming the environment, cars are expensive to run, but there are other methods of using cars in a more sustainable way!

The average cost of running a new car in 2013 was £6,689 according to the RAC. That’s £128 a week or 55p a mile.

But if you do need to use a car there are some more sustainable options available.

Car Sharing
Currently the average car occupancy is 1.58 persons per car. If that increased by 50% to 2.37 people, it would lead to a fall in traffic of 1/3 – significantly reducing congestion and reliability.

Benefits of car sharing:

Reduces the number of cars on the road – reducing pollution, congestion and parking problems
Reduces stress if you don’t do all the driving yourself
It’s sociable

As a car sharer at the University, you can apply for a half price car sharers permit here.

 

How to drive sustainably
If you do need to drive there are methods to drive in a more environmentally friendly way:

Keep tires properly inflated as properly inflated tires are safer, last longer and can improve your petrol mileage by >3%
Plan ahead for the shortest, most petrol-saving itinerary
Stay below 70mph as travelling above 70mph can use up 25% more fuel – making driving considerably more expensive
Try to avoid road rage! Aggressive driving wastes petrol, lowers petrol mileage and doesn’t help your stress levels
Using cruise control while on the motorway can save petrol
Get your car serviced regularly to maintain engine efficiency
Make sure you’re using the right specification of engine oil
Travel light and remove excess weight – do you really need all of that stuff in the boot?
Cold starts use more fuel so combine journeys to aid fuel efficiency
Drive smoothly, accelerate gently and look ahead to try and prevent unnecessary braking
Change up the gears earlier when the engine speed is at ~2000rpm in a diesel car and ~2500rpm in a petrol car
Take off roof racks to reduce drag
Don’t idle as an idle vehicle gives off 80% more pollution than one that’s moving. Turning the engine off and then back on again uses less fuel than idling longer than 30 seconds!
