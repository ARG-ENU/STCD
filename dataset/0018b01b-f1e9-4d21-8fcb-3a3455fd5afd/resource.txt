Tips:

Wearing a helmet is important
Remember to obey traffic lights and road signals
Don’t ride on the pavement unless a sign says you can
Use lights and reflectors so you are clearly visible
Don’t use headphones or a mobile while cycling
Bicycle Users Group (BUG)
bikeBUG includes University staff and studenta who travel by bike. The group aims to improve facilities around campus, providing an up-to-date website of important information for cyclists and co-ordinating various cycling events.

Cycle to Work
http://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/images/Cyclescheme-logo.JPGCyclescheme was introduced by the Government and works with the University to hire bikes and safety equipment for employee use. The University purchases the equipment and leases it out to the employee over 12 months. As payments are taken from gross salary, the employee makes savings of 30.4-52% on the purchase amount.

More Information:

Contact Jane Elliott-Simm at jane.elliot-simm@ncl.ac.uk  or +44 (0) 191 208 6311 for information relating to the scheme at Newcastle University
