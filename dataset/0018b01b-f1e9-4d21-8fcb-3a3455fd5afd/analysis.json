The group aims to improve facilities around campus, providing an up-to-date website of important information for cyclists and co-ordinating various cycling events.\n\nTo added to the BUG mailing list, please contact sustainable.campus@ncl.ac.uk with the subject \"Join BUG\".\nCycle to Work\nhttp://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/images/Cyclescheme-logo.JPGCyclescheme was introduced by the Government and works with the University to hire bikes and safety equipment for employee use. The University purchases the equipment and leases it out to the employee over 12 months. As payments are taken from gross salary, the employee makes savings of 30.4-52% on the purchase amount.\n\nMore Information:\n\nContact Jane Elliott-Simm at jane.elliot-simm@ncl.ac.uk  or +44 (0) 191 208 6311 for information relating to the scheme at Newcastle University\n\nFor more general information contact Cyclescheme on info@cyclescheme.co.uk or 0844 879 5101, or visit the website at http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/\n\nCycle security\nMake sure to use a D-lock to secure your bike and consider getting your bike frame security marked.
