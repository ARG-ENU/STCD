Walking is a great way to stay healthy, see the city and it's probably quicker than you think.

In London, at least 42% of adults are failing to meet the minimum levels of physical activity needed each week to stay healthy. The good news is that just 2, 10-minute walks a day can change that and improve your health and wellbeing: you'll sleep better, feel more relaxed, and significantly reduce the risk of developing a range of health problems, including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, depression and Alzheimer's disease.

Using public transport is a great way to build some walking into your day and people who regularly use public transport are more likely to get the activity they need to stay healthy.

If you want to keep track of your daily walking, use the free One You Active 10 walking app. Find out more
