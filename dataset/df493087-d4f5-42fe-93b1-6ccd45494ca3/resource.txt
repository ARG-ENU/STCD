Putting the power to choose a cleaner route in your hands

Air pollution is a serious problem affecting the health and lives of people in the UK, but with your help we could be on the cusp of change.

CleanSpace logoIf you’re concerned about air quality where you walk, run, or ride, help is at hand with CleanSpace. 

CleanSpace is a new social movement that aims to improve the air we breathe through encouraging small individual behaviour changes that, together, will make a big difference to the air pollution in cities across the UK.

What is CleanSpace?
CleanSpace is an app that provides local air quality information so you can know exactly how clean the air around you is and plan your journey to avoid high pollution zones.

CleanSpace encourages you to make small changes to the way you travel by rewarding you with 'CleanMiles' whenever you choose to walk, run or cycle.

These 'CleanMiles' can then be converted into rewards, which are available from CleanSpace's official partners.

How does CleanSpace work?
Air quality data from sources across the UK is interpreted by the Environmental Research Group at King’s College and fed into CleanSpace. This provides the information that enables you to choose cleaner air routes when you travel.

CleanSpace Tags - personal air pollution sensors - enable you to get a real-time measurement of air quality wherever you are.

This personal data will be fed into CleanSpace, creating an ever growing network of thousands of air quality sensors across the country. 

Air pollution is man-made and now is our chance to be part of the solution. Changing behaviour on a mass-scale is a tall order. But with global momentum already building behind a cleaner air movement, there’s no better time to work together to make a positive change.

Sustrans is a founding partner of the CleanSpace movement, launching in UK cities and then globally.

Watch this space for more information on how our schools programme in London will be working with CleanSpace to allow children and parents to plan a cleaner route to cycle, scoot or walk to school.
