Travel by Foot

The 2008 Staff Travel Survey revealed that just over 12% of staff live or travel within one mile of their place of work and that nearly 20.8% of car drivers are driving a distance that is only 1-2 miles to work.  It is highly possible, given congestion and parking problems, that these journeys could be walked quicker.  So if you live a couple of miles from your workplace and usually drive, why not try walking?

The table below indicates journey walking times:

Distance	 Walking time
(4 mph walking speed)
 1 mile	 15 mins
 2 miles	 30 mins
 3 miles	 45 mins
 4 miles	 60 mins
 5 miles	 75 mins
