Advanced driving
Advanced driving is all about making our roads a safer place – whether you are a driver, passenger, motorbike rider, cyclist or pedestrian. It involves being more considered in your driving style and having better control over your vehicle.

In 2012 there were around 200,000 reported accidents on UK roads where someone was injured, so anything we can do to make our roads a safer place is well worthwhile.

The organisations below offer a range of training and advice on how to drive more safely, including how to drive safely on motorways and HGV advanced driving.  Drivers with an advanced driving qualification can also benefit from reduced insurance premiums, thereby saving you money too.

Advanced driving organisations
As a charity the Institute of Advanced Motorists (the IAM) supports the raising of driving and riding standards and campaigns for increased on-road skills.

RoSPA Advanced Drivers and Riders aim is to reduce road accidents by encouraging an interest in road safety, by improving driving standards, knowledge and skill.
