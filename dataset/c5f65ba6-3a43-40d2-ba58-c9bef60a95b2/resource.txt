Smarter Driving Tips 
Smarter Driving Tips Petrol/Diesel prices on the up? Get more miles to the gallon, and save money on fuel costs, with our top tips for fuel-efficient driving:
1. Drive smoothly
Anticipate what’s happening ahead to avoid unnecessary braking or acceleration. Keep further from the vehicle in front so that you need to use the brakes less.

2. Shift up early
When accelerating, shift to a higher gear early, usually between 2,000-2,500 rpm.

3. Keep it steady
Maintain a steady speed, using the highest gear possible. Abrupt starts and stops waste fuel. Avoid excessive speeds: driving at 80mph uses 15% more fuel than driving at 70mph.

4. Start moving as soon as possible
A cold engine uses much more fuel. A car warms up faster when it is moving, so drive off as soon as possible after starting the engine.

5. Switch off
When you park or stop off the road, switch off the engine immediately. Sitting with the engine running burns fuel and wastes money.

6. Use the handbrake, not the clutch
Use the handbrake when you’re stationary and waiting to move away. Using the clutch adds to wear and tear and wastes fuel.

7. Pump up
Not only are under-inflated tyres dangerous, but they increase fuel consumption.

8. Lose some weight
Extra weight in your car means extra fuel to get you moving.

9. Switch off any unnecessary electricals
Air conditioning and window heaters use up extra fuel, so turn them off when they’re not needed!

10. Stay relaxed
Take it easy! Allow yourself a few extra minutes for your journey and enjoy a much less stressful time, rather than having to hurry and drive in an uneconomical way.
