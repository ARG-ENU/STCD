Car sharing or lift sharing – the choice is yours
Share your car by giving a lift to another person
Share journeys and the driving equally with another car driver/owner
Get a lift in someone else’s car if you don’t have transport
You can choose to share cars or lifts occasionally, or on a regular basis such as for the journey to work. You don’t have to commit to car share every day. Many sharers find they prefer to share journeys for a few days per week, making their own arrangements for other days. It’s entirely up to you.

Car sharing can also be done for just part of a journey – you may choose to combine car sharing with walking to build some exercise into your day, or perhaps would like to car share to a Park & Ride site and take advantage of the fast, frequent bus services from there into the city.
