Electric Vehicles
Electric Vehicles (EVs) benefit the environment by reducing carbon emissions and are also much more cost effective to run compared to petrol or diesel cars.

EV charging points are available at Coleraine and Magee campuses to support those staff, students and visitors who have switched to the more sustainable transport mode of electric cars while also assisting the University’s drive to reduce carbon emissions.

Additional EV charging points will also be provided in the Frederick St car park as part of the Greater Belfast Development.

The following sites are available for staff and students to charge their EVs around the University:
