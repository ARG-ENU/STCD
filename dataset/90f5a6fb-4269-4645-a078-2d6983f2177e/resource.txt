WATCH OUR ROAD CLOSURE VIDEO
School road closures are transformative, removing the congestion, pollution and other hazards posed by cars to put pupils and families first.

We went to Millfields Community School in East London, one of the schools taking part in WOW, our year-round walk to school challenge, to find out about the school road closure scheme run by the London Borough of Hackney, and how taking part has benefited pupils, parents and teachers.

WE SPOKE TO FELLOW WALKING EXPERTS IN AUSTRALIA AND CANADA.
Map of Australia
In Australia, projects that encourage whole communities to walk more, creating busier, more vibrant streets, are a key approach to getting more children walking to school.


Map of Canada
In Canada, harsh winter weather can be a major obstacle - but imaginative schemes like 'Winter Walking Days' (with hot chocolate rewards!) are proving effective.


As kids, we enjoyed walking to school because it was fun. Now, as adults, we understand all the additional reasons that active school travel is so important. It allows children to get to know their neighbourhoods, get exercise, and improve their concentration levels at school.
