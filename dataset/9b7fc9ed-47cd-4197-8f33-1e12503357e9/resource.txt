A WALKING NATION STARTS WITH YOU
For most of us, walking is as simple as putting on a pair of shoes and opening our front door. Yet it’s not always that easy.

That’s why we’re building a movement about a movement.

Together we can create a nation where people from all generations walk and enjoy the benefits that this simple act brings.

LIVING STREETS LOCAL GROUPS
A walking nation means local action. Our Local Groups help build a walking nation one street, community, town and city at a time.

We know that our strength lies in passionate and knowledgable people speaking out for the streets where they live.

Living Streets Local Groups are made up of dedicated campaigners who work with their local councils, neighbourhood groups and residents to make their streets more walkable.

Does this sound like something you would be interested in? Why not join a Local Group or if there isn’t one near you, we can help you set one up.

LET'S WALK TOGETHER
OCTOBER IS INTERNATIONAL WALK TO SCHOOL MONTH

A key part of our vision rests on the principle that, if we fix the Walk to School, we will go a long way to making our streets more walkable.

This October, we are calling on children, parents, carers and teachers (and everyone else!) to take to the streets, let us know how their walk to school measures up, and help us overcome the obstacles to the Walk to School.
