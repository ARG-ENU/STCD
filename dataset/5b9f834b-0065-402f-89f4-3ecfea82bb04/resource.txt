Why walk?
There are many benefits to walking in York:

To save money
Walking is completely free and the cheapest alternative to using the car. Best of all, it’s suitable for all ages and fitness levels. You’ll just need suitable clothing for different weathers and a comfy pair of shoes or trainers – save your smart shoes for the office!

To keep fit and active
Health experts recommend we do an average of 30 minutes a day of physical activity such as brisk walking or jogging to maintain an active lifestyle.

If you are interested in getting fit or maintaining your health, then walking is an ideal form of exercise. It’s completely flexible - you can choose to walk anywhere or anytime to fit in with your lifestyle. Walking is also  an activity you can equally enjoy alone or with a group of like-minded individuals, such as  through a walking group or a club. Walking as a social activity has grown enormously over the years and walking holidays are very popular.

Regular walking can improve confidence, stamina and energy, and help control your weight. It can also keep your heart strong and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure, bowel cancer and osteoporosis.

For a stress free journey
Journey times for walking remain constant, whatever the weather (except snow drifts!) so you’ll always be on time. Many big employers in York and both Universities are within easy walking distance (30 minutes) of the city centre.

Walking gives you plenty of opportunities for interacting with your environment – whether that’s just admiring the scenery or pretty gardens along the way, or getting to know people in your local community.
